    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h4>Main ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/2 lb Korean blood sausage (soondae)</li>
                    <li>2 cups of ox bone broth</li>
                    li>1/4 cup of garlic chives</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup of green onions (spring onions)</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup of perilla leaves</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons of green hot pepper</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon of salted shrimp</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 tablespoons of perilla powder</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Seasoning Paste ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tablespoon of hot pepper powder</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon of ox bone broth</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons of minced garlic</li>
                    <li>1/2 lb soup soy sauce</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon of minced ginger</li>
                    <li>1/8 teaspoon of black pepper</li>
                </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Before you make this soup, I recommend that you make the ox bone broth ahead of time. If you already have some in your freezer, it is a very quick and convenient way to enjoy your ox bone broth. We need 2 cups of it for this recipe.</li>
            <li>Next, for the main ingredient, we need about ½ lb of Korean blood sausage, soondae</li>
            <li>Reheat the soondae and cut the soondae rings into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients for the seasoning paste: 1 Tbsp hot pepper powder, 1 Tbsp ox bone broth, 2 tsp minced garlic, ½ lb soup soy sauce, ¼ tsp minced Ginger, and ⅛ tsp black pepper.</li>
            <li>In addition to the seasoning paste, we also need 1½ Tbsp of perilla powder and 1 tsp of salted shrimp for the nutty, savory, and hearty broth for this soup</li>
            <li>So, all the preparation is done. It is time to cook. You can use any small pot, but I recommend a clay or stone pot for the best result. Pour 2 cups of ox bone broth into your pot. Start to cook it on high.</li>
            <li>Once it starts to boil in about 12 mins, add the soondae into the broth. Here, it is important not to cook the soondae too long because it will easily break down into little pieces.</li>
            <li>Once it starts to boil again in a minute, quickly turn off the heat and put the veggie ingredients on top of the soondae.</li>
            <li>Put the seasoning paste, salted shrimp, and perilla powder on the veggies.</li>
        </ol>
